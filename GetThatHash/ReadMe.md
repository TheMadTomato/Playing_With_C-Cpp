This Program should always be run as administrator in order to run correctly. When launched correctly the program will save the hashes stored in HKLM\SAM and HKLM\SYSTEM (Basically the place where the hashes of your windows pc password is stored). Why? well it's a lil nice shortcut to quickly get the hashes and then use tools on kali such as "impacket-secretsdumps", "cupp", and "hashcat" to prepare for a Dictionary attack.
Sadly, the process of running the hashes through those 3 tools will only end in success if the user have weak password. But try to get as much info as possible about the target  in order for "cupp" to generate more possible words.
