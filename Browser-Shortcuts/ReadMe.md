# The Browser Shortucts Manual on linux

The Purpose of this program is to finally have a manual at hands reach whenever i forget certain Browser shortcuts. 
With the addition of Flags i can quikly show all the shortuct concerning a certain area in browsers;
such as -t --> tabs shortcuts
	-s --> search bar shortcuts
	-b --> booknark shortcuts
	-w --> window shotcuts
	-h --> help
	-v --> version

It is important to keep in mind that i am making it to cover the shortcuts of the browser i use; Brave Browser
It will be one of my first try to work with flags so i am really pumped up about it.
If more people face similar problems of forgetting shortcuts and want a quick reminder and if i get some support i would consider raising the bar.

So if anyone interested in making it into a tool for linux email me: TheMadTomato@proton.me
